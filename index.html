                            Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, primarily observed on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it.

                 <div>This part of the website was created by Mate, using mostly the cards part of Bootstrap. I find it very enjoyable myself and have respect for the people who can use it, as I didn't yet try it myself.</div>

                 <div>This part was created by Bruno, who I believe used some basic templates. Admittedly I didn't pay much mind to what he was doing, so maybe he didn't actually use any template but do it all from scratch.</div>
